*Use fairy magic to turn articles into podcasts*

## Overview

I love both podcasts and long-form articles. My favorite app for quite some time was Audm, which featured narration of written journalism, read by professional audiobook narrators. The NYT bought it and made it terrible.

I'd like to create audio files of posts for my own blog project. I'd also like to create a tool to easily convert any written content into engaging audio and make it accessible to a wide userbase.

To make it available on most devices and to learn a promising new framework, I'll be using Compose Multiplatform.

## Target Experience

The main screen is a list of generated audio. New audio can be generated by pressing a "Add New" 
button.

### Text provision
The generation process begins by providing an url or text. When providing an url, the user can also provide custom parsing instructions so that the article can be parsed without unwanted elements.

### Dynamic narration

Narration can use a single voice or multiple voices. For example, quotes or dialog might use different voices. Initial segmentation is provided by AI analysis. The result can be inspected and modified by the user.

## Architecture

* App data will be provided by a SQLite database. 
* Audio content can be saved locally. 
* The user can select among several options for AI services.

## License and funding

This app is free and open source. The source code is released under the MIT license. Patreon might be a means of funding development and infrastructure. As an alternative, paid versions of the app with cosmetic-only features might be available.

## Contribution

I am looking for help! Contact me if you are interested.
